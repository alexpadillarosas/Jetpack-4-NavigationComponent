# Jetpack-4-NavigationComponent
Based on a default project template Fragment + ViewModel.

This app shows the usage of a splash screen and the navigation component, basically passing an object as parameter.

The splash screen is used as a new theme, hence there is no activity for the splash screen which otherwise will make the user wait a defined period of time before showing the first screen of your app.

This version uses buttons to send different information to the next fragment(dragon's detail fragment).
We also use safeargs to pass the information via navigation controller.
